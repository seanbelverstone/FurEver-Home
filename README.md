# FurEver-Home
## Project Two

Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. As staggering as this is, Austin is doing its part in encouraging animal adoption. With companies like Austin Pets Alive, adoption is becoming easier, but still the process towards adopting an animal can be a long and arduous one.
Our application makes the whole process from choosing your next best friend, to bringing them to their furever home, much simpler. 
Simply log into the application, view the list of animals currently in Austin’s shelters and pick your pal. Our application allows you to save your favorites to a personal list for your review later and the large list of animals can be filtered by animal type, breed, age and time spent unadopted, among other practical filters. 
Each selection will display the animal’s details, along with their location and directions to get there.
